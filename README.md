#Overview

This repository contains two distinct projects that utilize MySQL to design, implement, and manage databases for real-world scenarios. Each task demonstrates database design principles, query execution, and data management capabilities.

Task 1: Hospital Management System

#Objective

The goal of Task 1 is to create a comprehensive database system for a hospital to manage critical operations like patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical record maintenance, and feedback collection. This database system is designed to ensure scalability, security, and data integrity while supporting efficient hospital operations and enhancing patient care quality.

#Key Features

Patient Management: Registration and maintenance of patient information.
Doctor Management: Storage of doctor details, including specializations and schedules.
Appointments: Scheduling and tracking appointments between patients and doctors.
Medical Records: Secure storage and management of patient medical histories.
Feedback System: Mechanism for collecting and analyzing patient feedback.
Scalability and Security: Incorporates data integrity constraints and secure data handling practices.
Compliance: Adheres to healthcare standards for data storage and privacy.

#Technologies Used

MySQL for database design and implementation.

#Implementation Steps

Database Design: Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram created to model relationships between entities.
Schema Creation: Tables for patients, doctors, departments, appointments, and feedback designed with primary and foreign key constraints.
Data Integrity: Implementation of constraints to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Query Execution: SQL queries used for CRUD operations and data analysis.

Task 2: Food Service Company Database

#Objective

The goal of Task 2 is to design and manage a database for a food service company, enabling the analysis of data patterns and insights from a dataset containing information about restaurants and consumers. This task emphasizes data integrity and the use of SQL for actionable insights.

#Key Features

Database Setup: Tables created for restaurants, consumers, orders, and cuisines.
Data Import: Real-world data extracted from CSV files and imported into the database.
Data Analysis: Execution of advanced SQL queries to analyze:
Popular cuisines.
Consumer demographics.
Restaurant performance metrics.
Constraints: Application of primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to maintain data accuracy and consistency.
Advanced SQL Features: Use of GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, aggregate functions, JOIN operations, subqueries, and stored procedures.

#Technologies Used

MySQL for database management and analysis.

#Implementation Steps

Database Design: Schema created to organize relationships between restaurants, consumers, and orders.
Data Import: CSV files imported into the database using MySQL tools.
Query Execution: Advanced SQL queries applied for insights and reporting.
Data Integrity: Constraints implemented to enforce consistency and prevent errors.

#How to Run

Install MySQL: Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system.
Import SQL Files:
Use the provided SQL scripts to set up the databases.
Import sample data from the CSV files.
Run Queries:
Execute the included SQL queries for both tasks to explore the data and analyze results.
